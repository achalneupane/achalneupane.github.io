[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I have been working on bioinformatics and statistical genetics focused projects. I have extensive experience in academic, clinical and industry collaborations with researchers in the US and Australia. I have gained key expertise in the analysis of large clinically focused datasets (mostly Cancer genomes). The goals of these research were to characterise and understand the genetic origin of disease and to translate these findings into clinical practice. In the past, I had analyzed a cohort of 150 clinically characterized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) sequenced with whole exome and whole genome sequencing, and a cohort of 900 control exomes and 600 whole genomes to validate and compare genotyping algorithms and sequencing technologies, and to perform gene discovery for both somatic and germline risk variants using sophisticated statistical genetics algorithms that identify both protective and deleterious variants. I used several variant calling methods to characterize germline, copy number and structural variants in AML. I also developed several algorithms (in R) for these studies, including to detect sample contamination, identity and ethnicity for quality control of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. I have also studied and compared pathology, cytogenetic and Sequenom genotyping data to refine and calibrate these algorithms.\nRecently, I have studied the effects of hypovirulence-associated DNA virus 1(SsHADV-1) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirus 2 Lactuca (SsHV2L) on white mold fungus pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum using smallRNAseq and RNAseq data. Over the years, I have worked on human (Cancer), plants, insects, fungal and Viral genome datasets.\nI am intereted in big data analysis, algorithm development, scientific computing, including analysis of biological (NGS)/non-biological datasets. During my graduate studies, I had taken several graduate level courses in Statistics, Computer science and Biological sciences to prepare myself for highly interdisciplinary fields, such as computational biology, including datascience.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I have been working on bioinformatics and statistical genetics focused projects.

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the MAPK genes utilized reference sequences from A. thaliana and G. max, yielding a total of 96 MPKs and 37 MKKs in the genomes of A. trichopoda, A. coerulea, C. reinhardtii, D. carota, H. annuus, S. lycopersicum, and S. fallax. Among them, 28 MPKs and eight MKKs were confirmed in H. annuus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed four clades within each subfamily. Transcriptomic analyses showed that at least 19 HaMPK and seven HaMKK genes were induced in response to salicylic acid (SA), sodium chloride (NaCl), and polyethylene glycol (Peg) in leaves and roots. Of the seven published sunflower microRNAs, five microRNA families are involved in targeting eight MPKs.

These contigs coded genomes larger than the regular mitoviruses infecting pathogenic fungi and can be translated by either a mitochondrial translation code or a cytoplasmic translation code, which was also reported in previously found mitoviruses infecting mycorrhizae.

We also identified signal peptides and nuclear localization signals present in the identified genes and their homologs. We found that NBS genes were located on all chromosomes and formed 75 gene clusters, one-third of which were located on chromosome 13. Phylogenetic analyses between sunflower and Arabidopsis NBS genes revealed a clade-specific nesting pattern in CNLs, with RNLs nested in the CNL-A clade, and species-specific nesting pattern for TNLs. Surprisingly, we found a moderate bootstrap support (BS = 50%) for CNL-A clade being nested within TNL clade making both the CNL and TNL clades paraphyletic. Arabidopsis and sunflower showed 87 syntenic blocks with 1049 high synteny hits between chromosome 5 of Arabidopsis and chromosome 6 of sunflower.

The MAPK genes form a 3-tier signal transduction cascade between cellular stimuli and physiological responses. Recent identification of soybean MAPKs and availability of genome sequences from other legume species allowed us to identify their MAPK genes. The main objectives of this study were to identify MAPKs in 3 legume species, Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, and Phaseolus vulgaris, and to assess their phylogenetic relationships. We used approaches in comparative genomics for MAPK gene identification and named the newly identified genes following Arabidopsis MAPK nomenclature model. We identified 19, 18, and 15 MAPKs and 7, 4, and 9 MAPKKs in the genome of Lotus japonicus, Medicago truncatula, and Phaseolus vulgaris, respectively. Within clade placement of MAPKs and MAPKKs in the 3 legume species were consistent with those in soybean and Arabidopsis. Among 5 clades of MAPKs, 4 founder clades were consistent to MAPKs of other plant species and orthologs of MAPK genes in the fifth clade-\u0026ldquo;Clade E\u0026rdquo; were consistent with those in soybean. Our results also indicated that some gene duplication events might have occurred prior to eudicot-monocot divergence. Highly diversified MAPKs in soybean relative to those in 3 other legume species are attributable to the polyploidization events in soybean. The identification of the MAPK genes in the legume species is important for the legume crop improvement; and evolutionary relationships and functional divergence of these gene members provide insights into plant genome evolution.\n","date":1385964000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385964000,"objectID":"f8fce080fe9b4b2193a50dd6ba7be66f","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/publication/mapk_legume/","publishdate":"2013-12-02T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/publication/mapk_legume/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract\nMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) genes encode proteins that mediate various signaling pathways associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses in eukaryotes.

We identified a total of 38 MAPKs, eleven MAPKKs, and 150 MAPKKKs in soybean. Within the GmMAPK family, we also identified a new clade of six genes: four genes with TEY and two genes with TQY motifs requiring further investigation into possible legume-specific functions. The results indicated the expansion of the GmMAPK families attributable to the ancestral polyploidy events followed by chromosomal rearrangements. The GmMAPK and GmMAPKKK families were substantially larger than those in other plant species. The duplicated GmMAPK members presented complex evolutionary relationships and functional divergence when compared to their counterparts in Arabidopsis. We also highlighted existing nomenclatural issues, stressing the need for nomenclatural consistency.
