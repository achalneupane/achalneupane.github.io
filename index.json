The goals of these research were to characterize and understand the genetic origin of disease and to translate these findings into clinical practice. In the past, I had analyzed a cohort of 150 clinically characterized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) sequenced with whole exome and whole genome sequencing, and a cohort of 900 control exomes and 600 whole genomes to validate and compare genotyping algorithms and sequencing technologies, and to perform gene discovery for both somatic and germline risk variants. For this, I used sophisticated statistical genetics algorithms that identify both protective and deleterious variants. I also used several variant calling methods to characterize germline, copy number and structural variants in AML. I also developed several algorithms (in R) for these studies, including to detect sample contamination, identity and ethnicity for quality control of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. I also compared pathology, cytogenetic and Sequenom genotyping data to refine and calibrate these algorithms.\nRecently, I have studied the effects of hypovirulence-associated DNA virus 1(SsHADV-1) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirus 2 Lactuca (SsHV2L) on white mold fungus pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum using smallRNAseq and RNAseq data. Over the years, I have worked on human (Cancer), plants, insects, fungal and Viral genome datasets.\nDuring my graduate studies, I had taken several \u0026ldquo;data-heavy\u0026rdquo; courses in Statistics and Computer science (besides Biological science) which fueled my interest in Data Science.

However, recent progresses in RNAi or dsRNA-based pest control requires more detailed characterization of the RNA silencing pathways in S. sclerotiorum to investigate the utility of dsRNA-based strategy for white mold control. This study elucidates the roles of argonaute enzymes, agl-2 and agl-4, in small RNA metabolism in S. sclerotiorum. Gene disruption mutants of agl-2 and agl-4 were compared for changes in phenotype, virulence, viral susceptibility, and small RNA profiles. The Δagl-2 mutant but not the Δagl-4 mutant had significantly slower growth and virulence prior to virus infection. Similarly, the Δagl-2 mutant but not the Δagl-4 mutant, showed greater debilitation under virus infection compared to uninfected strains. The responses were confirmed in complementation studies and revealed the antiviral role of agl-2. Gene disruption mutants of agl-2, agl-4, Dicer-like (dcl)-1, and dcl-2 did not change the stability of the most abundant endogenous small RNAs, which suggests the existence of alternative enzymes/pathways for small RNA biogenesis in S. sclerotiorum. Furthermore, in vitro synthesized dsRNA targeting agl-2 showed a significantly reduced average lesion diameter (P \u0026lt; 0.05) on canola leaves with agl-2 down-regulated compared to controls.

The present study dissects the RNA silencing pathway in S. sclerotiorum by disrupting its key silencing genes using the split-marker recombination method in order to probe the contributions of these genes, specifically argonautes, to fungal virulence and viral defense mechanisms. Following gene disruption, mutants were studied for changes in phenotype, pathogenicity, viral susceptibility, and small RNA processing compared to the wild-type strain, DK3. Among the argonaute mutants, the agl-2 mutant had significantly slower growth and virulence prior to and following virus infection. Additional analyses indicated that the virus-infected wild-type strain accumulated virus-derived small RNAS (vsiRNAs) with distinct patterns of internal and terminal nucleotide mismatches. Dicer 1 mutant produced less vsiRNA compared to dicer 2 mutant and the wild type strain, suggesting the two dicers are not in the state of complete redundancy. This finding expands our overall understanding of S. sclerotiorum and has important implications for any current or future uses of dsRNA and mycoviruses as disease control agents.\n","date":1563944400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563944400,"objectID":"4bc3c665c720fc0f7cad27884a42cab3","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/asv_2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-24T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/asv_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: Minneapolis, USA\nEvent: American Society for Virology\nAbstract\nProfiling the classes of the RNA silencing, also known as RNA interference, is an essential mechanism in plants, animals and fungi that functions in gene regulation and defense against foreign nucleic acids.

In fungi, RNA silencing has been shown to function primarily in defense against invasive nucleic acids. RNA-silencing- deficient fungi show increased susceptibility to virus infection. Plant pathogenic fungi also utilize RNA silencing to silence plant host immunity genes through the delivery of fungal small RNAs into plants. This cross-kingdom RNA silencing facilitates fungal infection of plants. Overall, these findings demonstrate the significant contributions of fungal RNA silencing pathways to fungal virulence and viral defense. This study dissects the RNA silencing pathway in S. sclerotiorum by disrupting its key silencing genes using the split-marker recombination method in order to probe the contributions of these genes, specifically argonautes, to fungal virulence and viral defense mechanisms. Following gene disruption, mutants were studied for changes in phenotype, pathogenicity, viral susceptibility, and small RNA processing compared to the wild-type strain, DK3. Among the argonaute mutants, the ∆agl-2 mutant had significantly slower growth and virulence prior to and following virus infection. Additional studies indicated that the virus-infected wild-type strain accumulated virus-derived smallRNAs(vsiRNAs) with distinct patterns of internal and terminal nucleotide mismatches. Additionally, dicer 1 mutant produced less vsiRNA compared to dicer 2 mutant and the wild type strain. These results together support that S. sclerotiorum has robust RNAsilencing mechanisms that function primarily in antiviral defense but also in endogenous gene regulation processes. This finding expands our overall understanding of S. sclerotiorum and has important implications for any current or future uses of mycoviruses as biological control agents, an emerging area of interest in fungal control research.\n","date":1547272800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547272800,"objectID":"a4f6bf78e7304328b86c1c5a819bab67","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/pag_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-12T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/pag_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: San Diego, USA\nEvent: Plant and Animal Genome Conference, XXVII\nAbstract\nProfilingRNA silencing, also known as RNA interference, is an essential mechanism in plants, animals and fungi that functions in gene regulation and defense against foreign nucleic acids.

Several MEK inhibitors have shown promising pre-clinical activity in AML, with a number of compounds currently in adult phase I/II clinical trials, including AZD6244, GSK1120212 and AS703026. Given not all patients respond to MEK inhibitor treatment we undertook a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of MEK inhibitors in AML and developed a clinically relevant model of resistance. The in vitroefficacy of 7 MEK inhibitors was determined using a diverse panel of 6 paediatric and 5 adult AML cell lines (Table 1). All AML cell lines were sensitive to at least one MEK inhibitor with the exception of the Down syndrome associated AML line, CMK, and the adult erythroblastic line, HEL, that showed overt resistance (IC50 \u0026gt;20μM) to MEK inhibition (Table 1). In sensitive cell lines, the reduced proliferation was associated with apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin V+ staining. To confirm mechanism of action, inhibition of MEK phosphorylation as well as the downstream kinase, pERK, were assessed by immunoblotting. The level of basal MEK activation was variable across the cell line panel and pMEK was increased upon exposure to active MEK inhibitors. In contrast, levels of pERK were reduced suggesting that MEK inhibitors may disrupt the interaction of MEK with its downstream transducers rather than a direct inhibition of MEK phosphorylation. Molecular and clinical resistance to kinase inhibitors is well described for targets such as FLT3 and BCR-ABL1. Since clinical responses to MEK inhibitors have been variable, we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to MEK inhibitors in vitro. Long-term culture of THP-1 cells (MLL-rearranged, NRASmutated) with AZD6244 and AS703026, resulted in high-level resistance. Importantly, cells displayed cross-resistance not only to these two compounds but also a third MEK inhibitor, GSK1120212 (Table 2). Resistance was associated with reduced basal pMEK expression. In order to establish the mechanism of resistance we performed comprehensive mutation and gene expression analyses utilising whole-exome sequencing and RNAseq respectively. These data revealed a spectrum of acquired molecular aberrations common to both resistant cell lines compared to the parental THP1 cells. Together, these data indicate that whilst MEK inhibition is a promising strategy to treat AML, resistance to one MEK inhibitor may lead to cross-resistance to other compounds targeting MEK.\n","date":1458104400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458104400,"objectID":"539eb55424ad86f403b2c1547e80887a","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/mek_brisbane_2016/","publishdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/mek_brisbane_2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: Peppers Noosa, Australia\nEvent: New Direction in Leukaemia Research, 2016\nAbstract\nMutations of the RAS family of genes are frequent events in AML, occurring in 10% of children and 10-20% of adults.

WES and Sequenom were 99.4% concordant over the selected gene panels (1594 measurements). The FLT3-ITD false negative rate initially exceeded 50%, leading us to optimize our discovery algorithms and develop a calibration curve which specified the sequence coverage needed over the FLT3-ITD region to reliably genotype at any allelic ratio (AR). We demonstrate that our algorithms can reliably detect FLT3-ITD with AR \u0026gt; 0.05 using exome capture with less than 100x coverage over the FLT3-ITD region. Additionally, we tested the algorithms over another 900 germline controls with no false positive measurements. In a validation phase using 78 samples, all NPM1mut samples (n=20 positive) were detected, including an additional NPM1mut (type A) initially missed using MALDI-TOF. Concordance with Sequenom again exceeded 99.5% (comparable to the error rate expected in this Sequenom panel). For FLT3-ITD, 18\u0026frasl;21 HRFA-positive samples were detected with all 3 false-negatives falling outside the predicted sensitivity threshold; two samples with AR \u0026lt;0.01 (which would require sequencing coverage of 500x for detection) and one with AR = 0.4 but with a sequence coverage of only 38x over the FLT3-ITD. In conclusion, we have performed WES on one of the largest cohorts of adult and paediatric AML described to date and demonstrate that clinically relevant mutations, including FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut, can be simultaneously detected with a single exome capture platform with accuracy similar to or better than current methods.\n","date":1441861200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441861200,"objectID":"4c3e271742d3183dc277147525076504","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/esh_2015_buddapest/","publishdate":"2015-09-10T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/talk/esh_2015_buddapest/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: Buddapest, Hungary\nEvent: European School of Hematology (ESH), 2015\nAbstract\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) can detect a high proportion of cancer causing genetic mutations, and therefore has the potential to replace targeted molecular assays and identify additional novel, patient-specific mutations.

Yes, the lines for Type I and Type II error overlap.\nNote: z_beta should be plotted relative to the alternative hypothesis value (in this case, d), since z_beta is the critical value to control for Type II error, where we would (fail to reject)* the null hypothesis and miss a true effect. Thus, the line for z_beta needs to be plotted relative to d, and it needs to be offset to the left, so you should be plotting a line at d-z_beta, etc. The alternative hypothesis is that the effect size we measured, d, is the true effect size. Perhaps another way to phrase this is, the right-hand distribution illustrates values of the true effect size d that are consistent with a measured effect size. There’s a big debate in statistics on the use of null hypothesis tests. Perhaps a better visualization would be to demonstrate how narrowing the distributions (2, 10, n) changes likelihood ratio or Bayes factor.\nIf you choose to solve this with SAS, I’ve included code in the SAS template to create the graphs, since combining plots in IML is not as easy as in R.\n  Exercise 4 In this, we compare the normal and Poisson distributions, using the functions you’ve written previously.

Adding new coordinate system, which will replace the existing one. Based on the execution time, looks like using the first formula takes a bit longer time to execute.\n   Exercise 5 Write a function, stat.power that combines calculations from Exercises 1 and 2. This function should accept \\(m_1, s_1, m_2\\) and \\(s_2\\) as required parameters, and \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) as optional parameters. This function must return a list with named elements CV, PercentDiff, EffectSize and RequiredReplicates.\nIf you choose to do this exercise in SAS, you will need to write a subroutine that accepts the same parameters as the R function, but also accepts output parameters CV, PercentDiff, EffectSize and RequiredReplicates. See https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2012/08/20/how-to-return-multiple-values-from-a-sasiml-function.html.\nAnother option for SAS is to package the calculations in a macro and create a data table, using the code from Course Outline SAS Source (under Course Outline \u0026gt; Outline Source and Output Files), about line 320.\nAnswer Define your function(s) in the code chunk below, the call the function with appropriate parameters in the following sections\n# function definition combined \u0026lt;- function (m1,m2, s1,s2, alpha=0.05, beta=0.2){ n \u0026lt;- 2* ((((sqrt((s1^2 + s2^2)/2))/(m1-m2))^2) * (qnorm((1-alpha/2)) + qnorm((1-beta)))^2) cohens_d \u0026lt;-(abs(m1-m2)/sqrt((s1^2+s2^2)/2)) cv \u0026lt;- (sqrt((s1^2+s2^2)/2))/((m1+m2)/2) percentdiff \u0026lt;- ((m1-m2)/((m1+m2)/2)) tt \u0026lt;- (list(CV=cv, PercentDiff= percentdiff, RequiredReplicates=round(n,0), EffectSize=cohens_d)) # attributes(tt) # names(tt) attr(tt, \u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;stat.power\u0026quot; #Setting a new class print.stat.power(tt) #use print.stat.power function below } If you define the class of the list returned by your function as stat.power, this function should work automatically; you shouln’t need to call the function explicity.\nprint.stat.power \u0026lt;- function(value) { cat(paste(\u0026quot;Coefficient of Variation :\u0026quot;,value$CV*100,\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)) cat(paste(\u0026quot;Percent Difference :\u0026quot;,value$PercentDiff*100,\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)) cat(paste(\u0026quot;Effect Size :\u0026quot;,value$EffectSize,\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)) cat(paste(\u0026quot;Required Replicates :\u0026quot;,value$RequiredReplicates,\u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;)) } 1936 versus 2006 m1=268.1 m2=384.4 s1=124.8 s2=168.3 combined(m1=m1, m2=m2, s1=s1, s2=s2) ## Coefficient of Variation : 45.4115573274988 ## Percent Difference : -35.647509578544 ## Effect Size : 0.784987603958648 ## Required Replicates : 25  1936 versus 1997 m1=268.1 m2=288.6 s1=124.8 s2=122.0 combined(m1=m1, m2=m2, s1=s1, s2=s2) ## Coefficient of Variation : 44.3355277160504 ## Percent Difference : -7.36482845338602 ## Effect Size : 0.166115727787307 ## Required Replicates : 569  1997 versus 2006 m1=288.6 m2=384.4 s1=122.0 s2=168.3 combined(m1=m1, m2=m2, s1=s1, s2=s2) ## Coefficient of Variation : 43.6803881088188 ## Percent Difference : -28.4695393759287 ## Effect Size : 0.651769377712577 ## Required Replicates : 37    ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"213bda1b894333dfd8b308ead173a387","permalink":"achalneupane.github.io/post/functions/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"achalneupane.github.io/post/functions/","section":"post","summary":"Statistic series","tags":["R","Statistics"],"title":"Functions","type":"post"}]
