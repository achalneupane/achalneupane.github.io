I also used several variant calling methods to characterize germline, copy number and structural variants in AML.

This exercise will repeat Exercise 1 from Homework 4, but using a data table.\nPart a.

However, in biobanked acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples, matched germline DNA is frequently unavailable. When germline samples a re available, sequencing both germline and somatic samples for each patient significantly increases costs. This study explores whether it is possible to utilise unrelated germline controls to identify ocogenic drivers.\nMethods :\nWhole exome sequencing was performed on somatic samples from 188 adults and children with AML (n=144 and n=44 respectively) and 429 control germline samples. The discovery process includes a rigorous statistical genetics approach whereby the AML cases and controls are age and ethnically matched. Residual population stratification is controlled by appropriate covariates. Burden tests are performed to detect mutations enriched in somatic samples compared to the unrelated germline controls. Statistical significance is determined by Q-Q plots against the null hypothesis.\nResults :\nBurden tests that included damaging protein coding mutations identified genes previously described with recurrent mutations in AML (e.g. NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH2, NRAS, RUNX1, FLT3, IDH1, TET2, ASXL1 ) thus validating th is bioinformatics approach. Furthermore, this methodology resulted in the detection of several additional novel genes not previously identified in AML. These mutations are currently undergoing conventional validation by Sanger sequencing, as well as bioinformatic validation using whole genome sequencing data from 128 of the same AML samples sequenced using the Complete Genomics platform.\nDiscussion :\nWe demonstrate that this methodology can: 1) Identify technical artefacts from sequencing and alignment. 2) Enable statistical modelling of allele frequencies that can identify low frequency clones which are undetectable using standard genotyping approaches. 3) Provide a purely statistical approach to gene discovery, agnostic to mutation type (synonymous, coding, non-coding etc).\nConclusions :\nIn summary, we have performed whole exome and whole genome sequencing on the largest cohort of AML samples in Australia. Innovative bioinformatic analysis has detected all previously identified, somatically mutated AML genes and has discovered a number of potentially significant novel mutations. The functional and prognostic impact of these events and the subsequent functional investigations will be discussed.\n","date":1471755600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471755600,"objectID":"2b845749eb8d1dda4a49c0a934dc5a5b","permalink":"/achalneupane.github.io/talk/leo_et_al/","publishdate":"2016-08-21T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/achalneupane.github.io/talk/leo_et_al/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: Melbourne, Australia\nEvent: International Congress of Immunology, 2016\nAbstract\nBackground :\nGene and mutation discovery in cancers is typically performed by sequencing somatic and germline samples from the same individuals and subtracting germline mutations.

NRASmutations promote proliferation through activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. Several MEK inhibitors have shown promising pre-clinical activity in AML, with a number of compounds currently in adult phase I/II clinical trials, including AZD6244, GSK1120212 and AS703026. Given not all patients respond to MEK inhibitor treatment we undertook a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of MEK inhibitors in AML and developed a clinically relevant model of resistance. The in vitroefficacy of 7 MEK inhibitors was determined using a diverse panel of 6 paediatric and 5 adult AML cell lines (Table 1). All AML cell lines were sensitive to at least one MEK inhibitor with the exception of the Down syndrome associated AML line, CMK, and the adult erythroblastic line, HEL, that showed overt resistance (IC50 \u0026gt;20μM) to MEK inhibition (Table 1). In sensitive cell lines, the reduced proliferation was associated with apoptosis, as assessed by Annexin V+ staining. To confirm mechanism of action, inhibition of MEK phosphorylation as well as the downstream kinase, pERK, were assessed by immunoblotting. The level of basal MEK activation was variable across the cell line panel and pMEK was increased upon exposure to active MEK inhibitors. In contrast, levels of pERK were reduced suggesting that MEK inhibitors may disrupt the interaction of MEK with its downstream transducers rather than a direct inhibition of MEK phosphorylation. Molecular and clinical resistance to kinase inhibitors is well described for targets such as FLT3 and BCR-ABL1. Since clinical responses to MEK inhibitors have been variable, we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to MEK inhibitors in vitro. Long-term culture of THP-1 cells (MLL-rearranged, NRASmutated) with AZD6244 and AS703026, resulted in high-level resistance. Importantly, cells displayed cross-resistance not only to these two compounds but also a third MEK inhibitor, GSK1120212 (Table 2). Resistance was associated with reduced basal pMEK expression. In order to establish the mechanism of resistance we performed comprehensive mutation and gene expression analyses utilising whole-exome sequencing and RNAseq respectively. These data revealed a spectrum of acquired molecular aberrations common to both resistant cell lines compared to the parental THP1 cells. Together, these data indicate that whilst MEK inhibition is a promising strategy to treat AML, resistance to one MEK inhibitor may lead to cross-resistance to other compounds targeting MEK.\n","date":1458104400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458104400,"objectID":"539eb55424ad86f403b2c1547e80887a","permalink":"/achalneupane.github.io/talk/mek_brisbane_2016/","publishdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/achalneupane.github.io/talk/mek_brisbane_2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: Peppers Noosa, Australia\nEvent: New Direction in Leukaemia Research, 2016\nAbstract\nMutations of the RAS family of genes are frequent events in AML, occurring in 10% of children and 10-20% of adults.

All subjects provided written informed consent, and the study protocols had been approved by institutional research ethics committees. Median age at diagnosis was 51 years, (range 1-89) and median bone marrow blast percentage was 76% (range 8-100). A discovery phase using 96 samples developed genotype algorithms and ascertained their sensitivity. NPM1mut were reliably detected using WES, with 100% (n=25 positive) concordance with MALDI-TOF. WES and Sequenom were 99.4% concordant over the selected gene panels (1594 measurements). The FLT3-ITD false negative rate initially exceeded 50%, leading us to optimize our discovery algorithms and develop a calibration curve which specified the sequence coverage needed over the FLT3-ITD region to reliably genotype at any allelic ratio (AR). We demonstrate that our algorithms can reliably detect FLT3-ITD with AR \u0026gt; 0.05 using exome capture with less than 100x coverage over the FLT3-ITD region. Additionally, we tested the algorithms over another 900 germline controls with no false positive measurements. In a validation phase using 78 samples, all NPM1mut samples (n=20 positive) were detected, including an additional NPM1mut (type A) initially missed using MALDI-TOF. Concordance with Sequenom again exceeded 99.5% (comparable to the error rate expected in this Sequenom panel). For FLT3-ITD, 18\u0026frasl;21 HRFA-positive samples were detected with all 3 false-negatives falling outside the predicted sensitivity threshold; two samples with AR \u0026lt;0.01 (which would require sequencing coverage of 500x for detection) and one with AR = 0.4 but with a sequence coverage of only 38x over the FLT3-ITD.

In total ~700 gigabases were sequenced. De novo transcriptome assembly was performed using four different short read assemblers for individual and pooled sets of reads. Hybrid assembly using both Illumina and 454 reads was also performed. After examining the assembly quality based on contig length and annotation effectiveness with similarity search, we chose the Trinity assembly from the pooled dataset including 163,871 contigs (the average length: 914 bp) as the most inclusive. We identified and annotated genes encoding chemoreceptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor, and glycoside hydrolase families. Compared to the sequences found in the draft genome, we observed variations in sequences as well as in the number of introns.

Herbarium records indicate that sickleweed was first introduced no later than 1922, and independent introduction of this plant took place in the East Coast and in the Midwest of the United States.","tags":null,"title":"Inferring Introduction History and Spread of Falcaria vulgaris Bernh.(Apiaceae) in the United States Based on Herbarium Records","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Achal Neupane**","Chezaray Anjorin","Xueqing Song","Deepak Kumar"],"categories":null,"content":"Location: Washington DC, USA\nEvent: HBCU-UP National Research Conference, 2009\nAbstract\nThe goal of this project was to study the responses of antibodies against four influenza A viruses; PR8, RV6, Swine and J1. RV6, Swine and J1 differ from PR8 by 1 amino acid (99.9% similarity), 20 amino acids, and more than 100 amino acids, respectively. Despite several attempts of early diagnosis and chemotherapy, breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in United States claiming almost 40610 lives per year. Breast cancer is more common in white women than in African American women but the survival rate for 5 years for African American women is comparatively less which is 77% than 90 % for white women. Higher concentration of estrogen secretion has also been associated with the risk factors of breast cancer. These viruses resemble the different viruses that circulate in people and that can have varying numbers of amino acid differences, and we wanted to examine how these difference affect the ability of antibodies to bind to different viruses using different techniques. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) was used to determine whether a particular antibody is present in a blood sample and ELISPOT (ELISPOT-Enzyme-linked Immunospot assay) was used for enumeration of B cells secreting specific antibody. In recent studies, metal-based anticancer drugs are found to be very effective in the death of cancer cells proving it as a very useful cancer chemotherapeutic. In this study we have synthesized ionic triorganotin compounds with increased solubility due to their partially ionic characteristic and tested their anticancer activity using MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. Methods: Three compounds (1) Triphenyltin Hydroxideparent compound CA11 and (3) CA 32 derivatives were tested. MDA-MB 231 cells were plated in 96-wellplate and treated with varying concentration (1ng to 100ug) of various triorganotin derivatives for 24, 48 and 72 hours. A combination of trypan blue dye exclusion and WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was used to\n","date":1256792400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1256792400,"objectID":"e7d5723ad441299c2f07dec7888ee1aa","permalink":"/achalneupane.github.io/talk/hbcu_neupane/","publishdate":"2009-10-29T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/achalneupane.github.io/talk/hbcu_neupane/","section":"talk","summary":"Location: Washington DC, USA\nEvent: HBCU-UP National Research Conference, 2009\nAbstract\nThe goal of this project was to study the responses of antibodies against four influenza A viruses; PR8, RV6, Swine and J1.
