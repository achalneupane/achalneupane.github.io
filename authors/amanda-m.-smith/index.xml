      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutations of the RAS family of genes are frequent events in AML, occurring in 10% of children and 10-20% of adults.
NRASmutations promote proliferation through activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. Several MEK
inhibitors have shown promising pre-clinical activity in AML, with a number of compounds currently in adult phase I/II
clinical trials, including AZD6244, GSK1120212 and AS703026. Given not all patients respond to MEK inhibitor
treatment we undertook a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of MEK inhibitors in AML and developed a clinically
relevant model of resistance.
The in vitroefficacy of 7 MEK inhibitors was determined using a diverse panel of 6 paediatric and 5 adult AML cell lines
(Table 1). All AML cell lines were sensitive to at least one MEK inhibitor with the exception of the Down syndrome
associated AML line, CMK, and the adult erythroblastic line, HEL, that showed overt resistance (IC50 &amp;gt;20μM) to MEK
inhibition (Table 1). In sensitive cell lines, the reduced proliferation was associated with apoptosis, as assessed by
Annexin V+ staining. To confirm mechanism of action, inhibition of MEK phosphorylation as well as the downstream
kinase, pERK, were assessed by immunoblotting. The level of basal MEK activation was variable across the cell line
panel and pMEK was increased upon exposure to active MEK inhibitors. In contrast, levels of pERK were reduced
suggesting that MEK inhibitors may disrupt the interaction of MEK with its downstream transducers rather than a direct
inhibition of MEK phosphorylation.
Molecular and clinical resistance to kinase inhibitors is well described for targets such as FLT3 and BCR-ABL1. Since
clinical responses to MEK inhibitors have been variable, we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to
MEK inhibitors in vitro. Long-term culture of THP-1 cells (MLL-rearranged, NRASmutated) with AZD6244 and
AS703026, resulted in high-level resistance. Importantly, cells displayed cross-resistance not only to these two
compounds but also a third MEK inhibitor, GSK1120212 (Table 2). Resistance was associated with reduced basal
pMEK expression. In order to establish the mechanism of resistance we performed comprehensive mutation and gene
expression analyses utilising whole-exome sequencing and RNAseq respectively. These data revealed a spectrum of
acquired molecular aberrations common to both resistant cell lines compared to the parental THP1 cells. Together,
these data indicate that whilst MEK inhibition is a promising strategy to treat AML, resistance to one MEK inhibitor may
lead to cross-resistance to other compounds targeting MEK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sensitivity of Whole Exome Sequencing for the Detection of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing (WES) can detect a high proportion of cancer causing genetic mutations, and therefore has the potential to replace targeted molecular assays and identify additional novel, patient-specific mutations. To test the ability of WES to detect variants of clinical consequence, we compared WES findings to results for FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut obtained by routine pathology testing (high-resolution fragment analysis (HRFA) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) respectively), and to point mutation findings in DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KRAS, NRAS and MPL, as determined by Sequenom, across a cohort of 188 AML samples from adults (n
= 144) and children (n = 44). All subjects provided written informed consent, and the study protocols had been approved by institutional research ethics committees. Median age at diagnosis was 51 years, (range 1-89) and median bone marrow blast percentage was 76% (range 8-100).
A discovery phase using 96 samples developed genotype algorithms and ascertained their sensitivity. NPM1mut were reliably detected using WES, with 100% (n=25 positive) concordance with MALDI-TOF. WES and Sequenom were 99.4% concordant over the selected gene panels (1594 measurements). The FLT3-ITD false negative rate initially exceeded 50%, leading us to optimize our discovery algorithms and develop a calibration curve which specified the sequence coverage needed over the FLT3-ITD region to reliably genotype at any allelic ratio (AR). We demonstrate that our algorithms can reliably detect FLT3-ITD with AR &amp;gt; 0.05 using exome capture with less than 100x coverage over the FLT3-ITD region.
Additionally, we tested the algorithms over another 900 germline controls with no false positive measurements.
In a validation phase using 78 samples, all NPM1mut samples (n=20 positive) were detected, including an additional NPM1mut (type A) initially missed using MALDI-TOF. Concordance with Sequenom again exceeded 99.5% (comparable to the error rate expected in this Sequenom panel). For FLT3-ITD, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; HRFA-positive samples were detected with all 3 false-negatives falling outside the predicted sensitivity threshold; two samples with AR &amp;lt;0.01 (which would require sequencing coverage of 500x for detection) and one with AR = 0.4 but with a sequence coverage of only 38x over the FLT3-ITD.
In conclusion, we have performed WES on one of the largest cohorts of adult and paediatric AML described to date and demonstrate that clinically relevant mutations, including FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut, can be simultaneously detected with a single exome capture platform with accuracy similar to or better than current methods.&lt;/p&gt;
