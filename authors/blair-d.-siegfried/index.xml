      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The     western     corn     rootworm,     Diabrotica     virgifera     virgifera(Coloeptera: Chrysomelidae), is one of the most devastating pests of corn causing nearly a billion dollars  of  financial  loss  both  in  terms  of  yield  loss  and  treatment  costs.  Although  Coleoptera  is  the  most  diverse  order  of  insects  comprising  more  than  400,000  species,  only  a  few  coleopteran  genomes  and  transcriptomes  (e.g.,  from  &lt;em&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;Dendroctonus  ponderosae&lt;/em&gt;)  have  been  published  to  date.  The  genome size of haploid D. v.   virgifera is estimated to be ~2.58 GB, one of the largest among beetle species. Its complete genome sequence is currently in the draft stage. In this study, in order to identify the gene sets expressed in their larval stages (when the  most  damage  to  corn  is  caused)  and  to  contribute  to  improving  the  genome  assembly,  we  have  sequenced  and  assembled  transcriptomes  from  egg,  neonate,  and third-instar larval stages of D. v. virgifera using next-generation technologies. In total  ~700  gigabases  were  sequenced.  De  novo  transcriptome  assembly  was  performed using four different short read assemblers for individual  and  pooled  sets  of  reads.  Hybrid  assembly  using  both  Illumina  and  454  reads  was  also  performed.  After  examining  the  assembly  quality  based  on  contig  length  and  annotation  effectiveness  with  similarity  search,  we  chose  the  Trinity  assembly  from  the  pooled dataset  including  163,871  contigs  (the  average  length:  914  bp)  as  the  most  inclusive.  We  identified  and  annotated  genes  encoding  chemoreceptors,  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  type  A  receptor,  and  glycoside  hydrolase  families.  Compared  to  the  sequences  found  in  the  draft  genome,  we  observed  variations  in  sequences  as  well  as  in  the  number  of  introns.  We  also  examined  conservation  of  gene   structures   in   chemoreceptors   from   closely   related   insect   lineages.   Our   transcriptome sequences can contribute toward improved quality of the &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;virgiferagenome&lt;/em&gt; assembly and annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
