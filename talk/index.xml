      <title>Profiling the Classes of the RNA Editing in Virus-derived small RNAs in White Mold Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profiling the classes of the RNA silencing, also known as RNA interference, is
an essential mechanism in plants, animals and fungi
that functions in gene regulation and defense against
foreign nucleic acids. In fungi, RNA silencing has
been shown to function primarily in defense against
invasive nucleic acids. RNA-silencing- deficient fungi
show increased susceptibility to virus infection. Little
is known about the classes of RNA editing in virus-
derived small RNA which will teach us the nature
of self-nonself recognition and ways to modulate
RNA modification to control fungal infections.
The present study dissects the RNA silencing pathway
in &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;sclerotiorum&lt;/em&gt; by disrupting its key silencing
genes using the split-marker recombination method
in order to probe the contributions of these genes,
specifically argonautes, to fungal virulence and viral
defense mechanisms. Following gene disruption,
mutants were studied for changes in phenotype,
pathogenicity, viral susceptibility, and small RNA
processing compared to the wild-type strain, DK3.
Among the argonaute mutants, the agl-2 mutant
had significantly slower growth and virulence prior
to and following virus infection. Additional analyses
indicated that the virus-infected wild-type strain
accumulated virus-derived small RNAS (vsiRNAs)
with distinct patterns of internal and terminal
nucleotide mismatches. Dicer 1 mutant produced
less vsiRNA compared to dicer 2 mutant and the wild
type strain, suggesting the two dicers are not in the
state of complete redundancy. This finding expands
our overall understanding of S. sclerotiorum and has
important implications for any current or future uses
of dsRNA and mycoviruses as disease control agents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ProfilingRNA silencing, also known as RNA interference, is an essential mechanism in plants, animals and fungi that functions in gene regulation and defense against foreign nucleic acids. In fungi, RNA silencing has been shown to function primarily in defense against invasive nucleic acids. RNA-silencing- deficient fungi show increased susceptibility to virus infection. Plant pathogenic fungi also utilize RNA silencing to silence plant host immunity genes through the delivery of fungal small RNAs into plants. This cross-kingdom RNA silencing facilitates fungal infection of plants. Overall, these findings demonstrate the significant contributions of fungal RNA silencing pathways to fungal virulence and viral defense. This study dissects the RNA silencing pathway in S. sclerotiorum by disrupting its key silencing genes using the split-marker recombination method in order to probe the contributions of these genes, specifically argonautes, to fungal virulence and viral defense mechanisms. Following gene disruption, mutants were studied for changes in phenotype, pathogenicity, viral susceptibility, and small RNA processing compared to the wild-type strain, DK3. Among the argonaute mutants, the ∆agl-2 mutant had significantly slower growth and virulence prior to and following virus infection. Additional studies indicated that the virus-infected wild-type strain accumulated virus-derived smallRNAs(vsiRNAs) with distinct patterns of internal and terminal nucleotide mismatches. Additionally, dicer 1 mutant produced less vsiRNA compared to dicer 2 mutant and the wild type strain. These results together support that S. sclerotiorum has robust RNAsilencing mechanisms that function primarily in antiviral defense but also in endogenous gene regulation processes. This finding expands our overall understanding of S. sclerotiorum and has important implications for any current or future uses of mycoviruses as biological control agents, an emerging area of interest in fungal control research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gene Discovery in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia: somatic and germline mutations.</title>
      <link>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/leo_et_al/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/leo_et_al/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene and mutation discovery in cancers is typically performed by sequencing somatic and germline samples from the same individuals and subtracting germline mutations.
However, in biobanked acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples, matched germline DNA is
frequently unavailable. When germline samples are available, sequencing both germline and somatic samples for each patient significantly increases costs. This study explores whether it is possible to utilise unrelated germline controls to identify ocogenic drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed on somatic samples from 188 adults and children with AML (n=144 and n=44 respectively) and 429 control germline samples. The discovery process includes a rigorous statistical genetics approach whereby the AML cases and controls are age and ethnically matched. Residual population stratification is controlled by appropriate covariates. Burden tests are performed to detect mutations enriched in somatic samples compared to the unrelated germline controls. Statistical significance is determined by Q-Q plots against the null hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burden tests that included damaging protein coding mutations identified genes
previously described with recurrent mutations in AML (e.g.
NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH2, NRAS, RUNX1, FLT3, IDH1, TET2, ASXL1) thus validating this bioinformatics approach.
Furthermore, this methodology resulted in the detection of several additional novel genes not previously identified in AML.
These mutations are currently undergoing conventional validation by Sanger sequencing, as well as bioinformatic validation using whole genome sequencing data from 128 of the same AML samples sequenced using the Complete Genomics platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that this methodology can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify technical artefacts from sequencing and alignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable statistical modelling of allele frequencies that can identify low frequency clones which are undetectable using standard genotyping approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a purely statistical approach to gene discovery, agnostic to mutation type
(synonymous, coding, non-coding etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;
:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we have performed whole exome and whole genome sequencing on the largest cohort of AML samples in Australia. Innovative bioinformatic analysis has detected all previously identified, somatically mutated AML genes and has discovered a number of potentially significant novel mutations. The functional and prognostic impact of these events and the subsequent functional investigations will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MEK inhibitor resistance in acute myeloid leukaemia</title>
      <link>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/mek_brisbane_2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/mek_brisbane_2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations of the RAS family of genes are frequent events in AML, occurring in 10% of children and 10-20% of adults.
NRASmutations promote proliferation through activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway. Several MEK
inhibitors have shown promising pre-clinical activity in AML, with a number of compounds currently in adult phase I/II
clinical trials, including AZD6244, GSK1120212 and AS703026. Given not all patients respond to MEK inhibitor
treatment we undertook a comprehensive preclinical evaluation of MEK inhibitors in AML and developed a clinically
relevant model of resistance.
The in vitroefficacy of 7 MEK inhibitors was determined using a diverse panel of 6 paediatric and 5 adult AML cell lines
(Table 1). All AML cell lines were sensitive to at least one MEK inhibitor with the exception of the Down syndrome
associated AML line, CMK, and the adult erythroblastic line, HEL, that showed overt resistance (IC50 &amp;gt;20μM) to MEK
inhibition (Table 1). In sensitive cell lines, the reduced proliferation was associated with apoptosis, as assessed by
Annexin V+ staining. To confirm mechanism of action, inhibition of MEK phosphorylation as well as the downstream
kinase, pERK, were assessed by immunoblotting. The level of basal MEK activation was variable across the cell line
panel and pMEK was increased upon exposure to active MEK inhibitors. In contrast, levels of pERK were reduced
suggesting that MEK inhibitors may disrupt the interaction of MEK with its downstream transducers rather than a direct
inhibition of MEK phosphorylation.
Molecular and clinical resistance to kinase inhibitors is well described for targets such as FLT3 and BCR-ABL1. Since
clinical responses to MEK inhibitors have been variable, we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to
MEK inhibitors in vitro. Long-term culture of THP-1 cells (MLL-rearranged, NRASmutated) with AZD6244 and
AS703026, resulted in high-level resistance. Importantly, cells displayed cross-resistance not only to these two
compounds but also a third MEK inhibitor, GSK1120212 (Table 2). Resistance was associated with reduced basal
pMEK expression. In order to establish the mechanism of resistance we performed comprehensive mutation and gene
expression analyses utilising whole-exome sequencing and RNAseq respectively. These data revealed a spectrum of
acquired molecular aberrations common to both resistant cell lines compared to the parental THP1 cells. Together,
these data indicate that whilst MEK inhibition is a promising strategy to treat AML, resistance to one MEK inhibitor may
lead to cross-resistance to other compounds targeting MEK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sensitivity of Whole Exome Sequencing for the Detection of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia</title>
      <link>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/esh_2015_buddapest/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing (WES) can detect a high proportion of cancer causing genetic mutations, and therefore has the potential to replace targeted molecular assays and identify additional novel, patient-specific mutations. To test the ability of WES to detect variants of clinical consequence, we compared WES findings to results for FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut obtained by routine pathology testing (high-resolution fragment analysis (HRFA) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) respectively), and to point mutation findings in DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KRAS, NRAS and MPL, as determined by Sequenom, across a cohort of 188 AML samples from adults (n
= 144) and children (n = 44). All subjects provided written informed consent, and the study protocols had been approved by institutional research ethics committees. Median age at diagnosis was 51 years, (range 1-89) and median bone marrow blast percentage was 76% (range 8-100).
A discovery phase using 96 samples developed genotype algorithms and ascertained their sensitivity. NPM1mut were reliably detected using WES, with 100% (n=25 positive) concordance with MALDI-TOF. WES and Sequenom were 99.4% concordant over the selected gene panels (1594 measurements). The FLT3-ITD false negative rate initially exceeded 50%, leading us to optimize our discovery algorithms and develop a calibration curve which specified the sequence coverage needed over the FLT3-ITD region to reliably genotype at any allelic ratio (AR). We demonstrate that our algorithms can reliably detect FLT3-ITD with AR &amp;gt; 0.05 using exome capture with less than 100x coverage over the FLT3-ITD region.
Additionally, we tested the algorithms over another 900 germline controls with no false positive measurements.
In a validation phase using 78 samples, all NPM1mut samples (n=20 positive) were detected, including an additional NPM1mut (type A) initially missed using MALDI-TOF. Concordance with Sequenom again exceeded 99.5% (comparable to the error rate expected in this Sequenom panel). For FLT3-ITD, 18/21 HRFA-positive samples were detected with all 3 false-negatives falling outside the predicted sensitivity threshold; two samples with AR &amp;lt;0.01 (which would require sequencing coverage of 500x for detection) and one with AR = 0.4 but with a sequence coverage of only 38x over the FLT3-ITD.
In conclusion, we have performed WES on one of the largest cohorts of adult and paediatric AML described to date and demonstrate that clinically relevant mutations, including FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut, can be simultaneously detected with a single exome capture platform with accuracy similar to or better than current methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transcriptome analysis of western corn rootworm larvae and eggs</title>
      <link>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/wcr_neupane/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/wcr_neupane/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The     western     corn     rootworm,     Diabrotica     virgifera     virgifera(Coloeptera: Chrysomelidae), is one of the most devastating pests of corn causing nearly a billion dollars  of  financial  loss  both  in  terms  of  yield  loss  and  treatment  costs.  Although  Coleoptera  is  the  most  diverse  order  of  insects  comprising  more  than  400,000  species,  only  a  few  coleopteran  genomes  and  transcriptomes  (e.g.,  from  &lt;em&gt;Tribolium castaneum&lt;/em&gt;  and &lt;em&gt;Dendroctonus  ponderosae&lt;/em&gt;)  have  been  published  to  date.  The  genome size of haploid D. v.   virgifera is estimated to be ~2.58 GB, one of the largest among beetle species. Its complete genome sequence is currently in the draft stage. In this study, in order to identify the gene sets expressed in their larval stages (when the  most  damage  to  corn  is  caused)  and  to  contribute  to  improving  the  genome  assembly,  we  have  sequenced  and  assembled  transcriptomes  from  egg,  neonate,  and third-instar larval stages of D. v. virgifera using next-generation technologies. In total  ~700  gigabases  were  sequenced.  De  novo  transcriptome  assembly  was  performed using four different short read assemblers for individual  and  pooled  sets  of  reads.  Hybrid  assembly  using  both  Illumina  and  454  reads  was  also  performed.  After  examining  the  assembly  quality  based  on  contig  length  and  annotation  effectiveness  with  similarity  search,  we  chose  the  Trinity  assembly  from  the  pooled dataset  including  163,871  contigs  (the  average  length:  914  bp)  as  the  most  inclusive.  We  identified  and  annotated  genes  encoding  chemoreceptors,  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  type  A  receptor,  and  glycoside  hydrolase  families.  Compared  to  the  sequences  found  in  the  draft  genome,  we  observed  variations  in  sequences  as  well  as  in  the  number  of  introns.  We  also  examined  conservation  of  gene   structures   in   chemoreceptors   from   closely   related   insect   lineages.   Our   transcriptome sequences can contribute toward improved quality of the &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;virgiferagenome&lt;/em&gt; assembly and annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identification of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Family Members in Soybean</title>
      <link>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/bsa_neupane/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/bsa_neupane/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine specific kinases that are induced by various extracellular and intracellular stimuli, and are involved in signaling pathways in all eukaryotes. In plants, MAPKs are known to regulate various signal transduction pathways including those associated with biotic and abiotic stresses. The MAPK gene members belong to three functionally linked gene families called MAPKs, MAPKKs (MAPK Kinases) and MAPKKKs (MAPKK Kinases). Although, MAPKs of model plants such as &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Oryza&lt;/em&gt; have been identified and characterized, these genes in soybean (&lt;em&gt;Glycine max&lt;/em&gt;) are yet to be identified. In this study, we used approaches in comparative genomics and bioinformatics for the genome-wide identification of MAPKs, MAPKKs and MAPKKKs in soybean. &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; reference sequences were used in protein BLAST to search the putative MAPKs of soybean from publicly available databases. In our in-silico analysis, the redundant sequences were removed to perform unbiased and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. We verified the presence of unique conserved domains and active sites in each putative MAPK gene member manually and by using Geneious and Pfam programs. From our three different confirmatory analyses, we identified 38 MAP Kinases, 11 MAPK Kinases and 115 MAPKK Kinases in soybean. &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; nomenclature model was followed to assign numeric subscript to MAPK sequences grouped with &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/em&gt; sequences in phylogenetic tree. Lack of effective code of nomenclature lead us to a conundrum, which will be discussed in the meeting. Universal codes of gene nomenclature are crucial for understanding various signaling pathways. Therefore, an effective code of gene nomenclature is warranted. The results from this study will help us characterize soybean MAP Kinases paving avenue for the functional analyses of different cellular and physiological pathways in the order these genes function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anticancer Activity of Novel Ionic Triorganotin Derivatives against MDA-MB 231 Breast Cancer Cells</title>
      <link>/achalneupane.github.io/talk/hbcu_neupane/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to study the responses of antibodies
against four influenza A viruses; PR8, RV6, Swine and J1. RV6,
Swine and J1 differ from PR8 by 1 amino acid (99.9% similarity),
20 amino acids, and more than 100 amino acids, respectively.
Despite several attempts of early diagnosis and chemotherapy,
breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in
United States claiming almost 40610 lives per year. Breast cancer
is more common in white women than in African American women
but the survival rate for 5 years for African American women is
comparatively less which is 77% than 90 % for white women.
Higher concentration of estrogen secretion has also been
associated with the risk factors of breast cancer.
These viruses resemble the different viruses that circulate in
people and that can have varying numbers of amino acid
differences, and we wanted to examine how these difference
affect the ability of antibodies to bind to different viruses using
different techniques. ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
Assay) was used to determine whether a particular antibody is
present in a blood sample and ELISPOT (ELISPOT-Enzyme-linked
Immunospot assay) was used for enumeration of B cells secreting
specific antibody.
In recent studies, metal-based anticancer drugs are found to be
very effective in the death of cancer cells proving it as a very
useful cancer chemotherapeutic. In this study we have
synthesized ionic triorganotin compounds with increased solubility
due to their partially ionic characteristic and tested their anticancer activity using MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells.
Methods: Three compounds (1) Triphenyltin Hydroxide[parent
compound] (2) CA11 and (3) CA 32 derivatives were tested.
MDA-MB 231 cells were plated in 96-wellplate and treated with
varying concentration (1ng to 100ug) of various triorganotin
derivatives for 24, 48 and 72 hours. A combination of trypan blue
dye exclusion and WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was used to&lt;/p&gt;
